Our CEST MRI protocol consisted of CEST-Fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) MR images acquired at different saturation frequencies using 5 ?T saturation powers and saturation time of 5 s. The FISP protocol contained a 35.7461 ms repetition time (TR); 12.6781 ms echo time (TE); gauss hermite excitation pulse;  60° excitation angle; 1 mm slice thickness; 6.0 x 6.0 cm field of view (FOV);  0.2332 mm2 plane resolution; 128 x 128 resolution matrix; centric encoding order; unbalanced “FID” mode; and 500 ms scan time. We ran two acquisitions of 4 and 101 CEST excitation frequencies ranging from -50 to -47 ppm and -5 to 20 ppm respectively. The CEST saturation period consisted of a series of Gaussian-shaped radio frequency pulses with an interpulse delay of 10 ?s and no additional spoiling of fat saturation pulses. We ran the CEST-FISP sequence nine times, one for each cradle containing the same pH samples at different concentrations. We then analyzed CEST effect data through the following equation:
        (1)     Z(A, ?, x)= 1-?_(n-1)^4?(A_n ??^2?_n/4)/(??^2?_n/4+(x_o-x_n )^2 )
